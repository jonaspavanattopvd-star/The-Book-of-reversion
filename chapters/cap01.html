                                     - I think you've already noticed that I'm a wizard-
		
	It was just another ordinary night in James’s life. A fifteen year old boy getting into high school. He was in his bedroom, which, as usual, was an absolute mess. He wore warm pajamas with a galaxy print and a light blue hoodie over them. His short, dark brown hair was messy, covered by his hood. He used it to block the light from the bedside lamp that shone directly into his light brown eyes, which, under the orange glow, resembled a sunset.
Books were scattered on the floor, and his blanket was completely out of place, tangled beside the bed. He was reading a book that was incredibly exciting. It wasn’t the first book he had read that night—James loved reading. At school, he was unpleasantly nicknamed “the book devourer.”
However, in the middle of his reading, a wind began to build around him. James looked ahead and saw a dark whirlwind quickly forming. Within seconds, it expanded and gained speed until it exploded with a bang. In the center of the smoke stood a boy who looked about sixteen years old. He wore a black cloak, and underneath it, a shirt unbuttoned at the collar and a black vest over it. None of his facial features could be clearly seen, as the hood over his head hid most of them.
The mysterious boy quickly grabbed James’s arm, causing him to drop the book. The moment he looked to the side, trying to see where the book had fallen, he felt the wind swirling violently around him. Everything seemed to shrink into an imperfect spiral in the hand of the hooded boy holding his arm. In an instant, they were standing in a dark alley in London. James felt a slight wave of nausea, but it was completely overtaken by his immense confusion.
When he opened his mouth to speak, the mysterious boy made a gesture for silence, which irritated James. Still trying to process what had just happened, the boy pulled a kind of wand from inside his tattered jeans and began murmuring incantations while the tip of the wand slightly lights up, along with a couple shiny blue stripes on the base:
-krývio malignum, impetum repellere, kalýpto.
When he finished the spells, he looked at James with a grin, almost laughing, and said:
-I think I owe you some explanations.
	James tried hard not to curse at him and simply nodded, clearly afraid.
The boy pulled back his hood and revealed his face. He had black, wavy hair, reasonably short and noticeably messy from the hood. His eyes were dark green, and his pupils were quite dilated due to the dim light in the alley at that late hour.
-Well, my name is Max, and I think you’ve already noticed I’m a wizard—or something like that. So, I’ll get straight to the point… I brought you here to tell you that you are one too.
James tried to say something but couldn’t, so the boy continued:
-I came to talk to you because I think it’s unfair that you don’t get proper training. I’m what wizards call a half-blood—in my case, my mom’s a witch and my dad’s a nonwiz.
James looked confused.
Max noticed the expression on his face and explained:
-That means a non-magical person… We’re living in difficult times. There are anti-nonwiz movements everywhere, and apatomagus—He noticed James’s confused look again and clarified:
-Wizards born to non-magical parents… Well, they’ve been expelled from the G.C.A.V Program-Max added-That’s where you´re gonna learn everything…
The boy show a little smile and asks:
-I’d like to take you there… Classes start the day after tomorrow by the way. Max gave  a little smile.
-But I can’t just leave my parents, and I…
-I’ve already taken care of them… Actually, I only saw your mother. I don’t know who your father is.
Desperate, James asked:
-WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO!? the little boy clench his hands, and try to hit a punch on face of the wizard
-Relax man-Max replied, while dogging-I just altered her memory so she thinks you’re sleeping over at a friend’s house. After we buy your supplies, we’ll go back and restore it to normal.
	James hesitated for a moment, but despite his reluctance, he eventually accepted the invitation, nodding with a fearful expression.
Max extended his hand to James. When James touched it, he felt the air stir and everything being sucked toward where their hands met. With a loud bang, they appeared in front of a pub.
It was clearly made of very old bricks. Beside the door—made of slightly dark wood—there was a small lantern, and beneath it, a metal plaque with an engraving of two tankards crossing in front of each other.
-This is the whispery tankard. Max said, then opened the door and added:
-Come in. We’ll spend the night here, and tomorrow we’ll get everything.
