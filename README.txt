The Book of Reversion - Static site (dark theme) for GitHub Pages
--------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains a minimal static site template (dark theme) for publishing a light novel.
Files included:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- chapters/cap01.html

How to publish on GitHub Pages (quick):
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. the-book-of-reversion).
2. Upload all files and folders from this package to the repository root.
3. In GitHub, go to Settings -> Pages -> Source -> choose 'main' branch (or 'master') and root (/).
4. Save. Wait a minute. Your site will be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

Notes:
- Chapter files are in the /chapters folder. Add new files as cap02.html, cap03.html...
- This template is static and client-side only.
- If you want me to prepare the repository with these files as a ZIP or help with Git commands, tell me and I will create the ZIP here.
